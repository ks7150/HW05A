The dataset i used was the one provided on the class website, it was about the Air Quality in Beijing which stateed the different parameters measured, like the Temperature, the Dewpoint, the pm2.5 levels in the air among others. I tried to map out the variations and the relations in the temperature and the dewpoint.
I tried to map out the dewpoint values and the temperature values respectively, ranging from the minimum values to their maximum ones and visualised 1000 points respectively. I used rectangles to represent the data. With each starting from 10,10 and the width correspoinding to the relative mapped out value of temperature, and height mapped out to the value of the dewpoint.
